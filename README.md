# GMUD-Explorer  

GMUD Explorer is a spin off of MMUD Explorer.  Syntax did a wonderful job with MME, but as GreaterMUD continues to evolve having it's own version of MME provides for more updates that are specific to the GreaterMUD game.

v1.0.1 (03/18/2021)  
------------------------------------------  
* Updated tab index on Character and Equipment tabs
* Fixed issue with +/- buttons on stats and on AC (there are still others that are broken)
* Updated swing calculator to allow for 6 swings and the GMUD QnD calculation
* Updated the Bless dropdowns, they're now tied to the global filter and show only spells usable by the chosen class
* Fixed the room 0/0 bug
* Added a global ctrl+a to select all from textboxes on frmMain (which is most of the app)
